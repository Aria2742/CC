A quick disclaimer before getting into the details: This is a malicious program, but I do not intend for it to be used maliciously. I wanted to challenge myself with a large project, and I'm most interested and motivated to build malicious programs like this. I do not condone the malicious use of this program outside your own computer/VMs.

## Overview
This program is designed to work like a remote access trojan by providing control over a remote computer. This section will be expanded as the program is developed more...

## Planned Features
* file system traversal
* upload files
* download files
* run commands
* video feed of victim's screen
* control of victim's mouse
* control of victim's keyboard
